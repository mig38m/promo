# headers

Access HTTP headers on both server and client.
Confirmed working with both Meteor 0.6.4 and 0.6.5.

## On the Server

Use `headers.get()` to access HTTP headers sent by the client.
`headers.get(key)` will retrieve a specific header, e.g.
headers.get('host'), whereas headers.get() will return an object
with all headers.

Note that all header field names are *lowercase*.  e.g. 
`headers.get('accept-language')`, `headers.get('x-forwarded-for')`,
etc (like with ExpressJS [req.get](http://expressjs.com/api.html#req.get)).

## On the Client

As above.  Note that the headers are sent back over the wire via a Meteor
method call, when the script is loaded.  If you try access it too early,
it won't be there, but from my own experience, it's always been available
from `Meteor.startup()` onwards.  If you have problems, let me know,
and I'll implement a callback solution.

You may wonder why the headers have to make a round trip from
client->server->client.  Unfortunately, these headers are NOT available from
the browser via Javascript.  There's a trick to make an XHR request in the
browser to get the headers, but note, this does NOT INCLUDE ALL HEADERS.
Unfortunately the ONLY reliable method, to get all headers with their correct
values, is via the server.
